# Formula 1: The Concept
Welcome to F1: The Concet, a concept website for Formula 1! Learn all about the thrilling motorsport that is Formula One through a dynamic website that introduces teams, drivers, race rules and concepts using beginner-friendly terminology. Tools made by the developer (Leah, aka tomatoisthyname) can help experienced fans gain insight into their favorite parts of F1. 
Tools such as team/user and driver/user matching as well as driver performance predictors are availible, with the option of AI integration. AI disclaimers are displayed at the top of page. 

## Tools and Technologies
This website would not be possible without the many free and usually open-source techonolgies procured by the Formula One community. These include:
  - FastF1 API
  - Currently the only one I can think of right now! 

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome, as this is an open-source and community project. Please open a discussion discussing your ideas and complete pull requests in a timely manner. Please bear with me, as I am not a coding god; my questions are not questions of criticism or scrutiny, but rather (most likely) a need for better understanding :D 

Descriptive commits are important! Please follow the widely-used git commit standard outlined here: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

## About the Dev:
I am currently a junior at New York Univeristy, studying abroad in Paris. I am working towards a dual major in Computer & Data Science with a minor in German (though now I am learning French...). I (as you can tell) love Formula One. Piastri is my favorite driver (Verstappen is a close second), been rooting for him since Saudi Arabia 2024 (aka the first F1 race I watched). Whenever I'm not on my computer, I am touching grass, which is not a euphamism in this case since I love to hike, swim, and go to the beach.
